# EconophysiX_Internship
This repository contains my research project at Ã‰cole Polytechnique for my second gap year's internship.

Mainly, it is a try of microfounding the Propagator Model for market impact (proposed by Jean Philippe Bouchaud et al) within a Kyle-like setup where noise trader are strategic (in a sense that they have an utility to maximize),

The original paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10242.

For a theoretical material on what is being coded, feel free to read the internship's background notes at: https://www.overleaf.com/read/mwtxjbgctmnv

Keywords: Market Microstructure, Quantitative Finance, Econophysics, Statistical Physics.
